	approaches. Although he also makes use of abstract formulations of
	certain classes of equations in terms of operators between Banach
	spaces, his approach is by no means reduced to the functional-analytic
	setting. The author presents essential ideas in very clear settings,
	avoiding technicalities required by sharp versions of the theorems.
	Each part of the book is largely self-contained. Each chapter of
	the book is complemented by problems and references to research articles
	and advanced monographs.\par The book is divided into three parts:
	representation formulae for solutions, linear and nonlinear PDE.
	The first part consists of three chapters devoted to four important
	linear PDE (transport, Laplace's, heat and wave equation), nonlinear
	first-order PDE (complete integrals, characteristics, {Hamilton-Jacobi}
	equations, conservation laws) and other ways to represent solutions
	(separation of variables, similarity solutions, transform methods,
	converting nonlinear into linear PDE, asymptotics, power series).
	The three chapters of the second part (linear PDE) deal with Sobolev
	spaces, second-order elliptic equations (existence of weak solutions,
	regularity, maximum principles, eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) and
	linear evolution equations (second-order parabolic and hyperbolic
	equations, hyperbolic systems of first-order equations, semigroup
	theory). The last part (nonlinear PDE) is subdivided into four chapters
	dealing with variational methods (first and second variation, existence
	of minimizers for convex and polyconvex functionals, regularity,
	constraints, Mountain Pass Theorem), nonvariational techniques (monotonicity
	and fixed point methods, sub- and supersolutions, nonexistence results,
	geometric properties of solutions, gradient flows), {Hamilton-Jacobi}
	equations (viscosity solutions, uniqueness, control theory, dynamic
	programming) and systems of conservation laws (Riemann's problem,

	fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations (PDEs).
	A new notion of weak solutions, called moment solutions, is introduced
	for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. Unlike viscosity solutions,
	moment solutions are defined by a constructive method, called the
	vanishing moment method, and hence, they can be readily computed
	by existing numerical methods such as finite difference, finite element,
	spectral Galerkin, and discontinuous Galerkin methods. The main idea
	of the proposed vanishing moment method is to approximate a fully
	nonlinear second order PDE by a higher order, in particular, a quasilinear
	fourth order PDE. We show by various numerical experiments the viability
	of the proposed vanishing moment method. All our numerical experiments
	show the convergence of the vanishing moment method, and they also
	show that moment solutions coincide with viscosity solutions whenever

	journal = {IGPM Report},
	year = {2009},

	month = {August},
	abstract = {Adaptive multiscale methods are among the most effective techniques
	for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Efficient
	grid management is an important task in these solvers. In this paper
	we focus on this problem for Discontinuous {Galerkin} discretization
	methods in 2 and 3 spatial dimensions and present a data structure
	for handling adaptive grids of different cell types in a unified
	approach. Instead of tree-based techniques where connectivity is
	stored via pointers, we associate each cell that arises in the refinement
	hierarchy with a cell identifier, and construct algorithms that establish
	hierarchical and spatial connectivity. By means of bitwise operations,
	the complexity of the connectivity algorithms can be bounded independent
	of the level. The grid is represented by a hash table which results
	in a low-memory data structure and ensures fast access to cell data.
	The spatial connectivity algorithm also supports the application
	of quadrature rules for face integrals that occur in Discontinuous
	{Galerkin} discretizations. The concept allows to implement Discontinuous
	{Galerkin} methods largely independent of spatial dimension and cell
	type. We demonstrate this by outlining how typical algorithmic tasks
	that arise in these implementations can be performed with our data
	structure.},
