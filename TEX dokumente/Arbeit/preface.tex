This thesis discuss discontinuous Galerkin methods for the \MA equation. 
The \MA equation is the best-known fully nonlinear partial differential equation PDE. It suffices as a prototype problem for numerical scheme challenging fully nonlinear problems and thus enjoys great popularity among the nonlinear PDE community.

Next to its purely mathematical applications equations of \MA type arise in many other fields such as astrophysics, computer science, differential geometry, image processing, finance, optimal transportation and optics\cite{FGN2013}. 
In optics for example the surface of a lens projecting a desired illumination or even image can be described by a \MA equation\cite{KW2010, BHP2014}. \\
These applications demand for efficient and reliable numerical schemes and thus
